# NewsFeed
This App displays a list of articles related to a specific topic.
The UI will be populated with articles based on the key word entered by the user.
When opened for the first time, the UI displays news articles.

The UI responds to clicks by sending the user to the webpage of the article. 
By clicking on the share Icon of an article, a share Intent is created with the title and the web link of the article.  

The data are queried from the Guardian API.
